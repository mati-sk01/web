                        Style of Play
                    </h2>
                    <p>Sancho can function as a second striker or wide midfielder typically in 
                      a Borussia Dortmund 4–2–3–1 formation on either wing of attack. Dortmund's
                       "young player project" helped Sancho function in the focal point of attack
                        alongside a core of talented young stars like Erling Haaland, Gio Reyna and 
                        Jude Bellingham.

                      Regarded as a quick, highly technical, and creative player, with excellent dribbling 
                      skills and ball control, Sancho is known for his trickery and use of feints in one-on-one
                       situations and has been described as one of the world's best young players.
                       Although he is known in particular for his ability to get past 
                       opponents and create chances for teammates, he is also capable of scoring goals himself.
